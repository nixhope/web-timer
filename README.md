# Web-timer
Web timer is a simple web app for timing short activities, such as exercises, cirtcuit training, HIIT (high intensity interval training), stretching etc.

Being a simple application, it can run readily via the browser on mobile devices, for a (hopefully) comparable experience to native apps.

Note: This is not meant to be used as a stop-watch! It is intended to be used for timing fixed-duration activities.

## Intended features
- Countdown or count up to a target inteval
- Interval feature - designed to have a cooldown/preparation period between each timed activity

## Potential enhancements
- Allow users to create lists of activities with time and custom labels
- Add customisable embedded images or video on the timer page (e.g. diagrams for stretches).
